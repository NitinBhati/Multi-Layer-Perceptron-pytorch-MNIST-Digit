# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-pytorch-MNIST-Digit
Train an MLP to classify images from the MNIST database for hand-written digit database

The process will be broken down into the following steps:

1. Load and visualize the data
2. Define a neural network
3. Train the model
4. Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!
